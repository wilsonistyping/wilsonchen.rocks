                  <br><h5> On Consciousness and Feeling Bad for Mosquitoes </h5><br>
                  <p>I squashed a mosquito in the bathroom of our house today.</p>
                  <p>I was out on the patio exercising when I heard my little sister call my name with a mildly panicked tone. She told me that there was a giant mosquito flying on the walls of the master bathroom, and she asked me to kill it.</p>
                  <p>So there I went. Sure enough, as I walked in, an almond-sized mosquito with spider-like legs bounced nonchalantly along the white tiles lining the bathroom wall. I grabbed a paper towel and struck it down in one fell swoop.</p>
                  <p>The mosquito bouncing with life just moments prior succumbed to gravity, a life lost in less than a blink of an eye.</p>
                  <p> ... </p>
                  <p>If there’s one thing that I fear most in life, it’s its absence. With death, we lose our consciousness, and in consequence, we lose ourselves. Life is something that we only have temporarily, and it’s something we’ll never have again (unless some miracles are discovered in this century).</p>
                  <p>For a moment, I felt bad for that bug. I felt bad for the millions of organisms that die every moment, because for all we know, they’re alive. At least, they were.</p>
                  <p>None of us knows what happens when we die. The religious amongst us say we go elsewhere, to heaven or hell, or some other world altogether. Others believe in reincarnation, where our memories get wiped and we begin anew.</p>
                  <p>While these answers may give us peace of mind about our imminent deaths, what happens to the mosquito? Is there a separate heaven for mosquitoes? What about factory-raised cows, bred and killed for mass consumption? What’s it like to be an unfortunate ant, at the wrong place at the wrong time, trampled by an unaware human on their daily commute to work?</p>
                  <p>The fragility of life seems to be too taboo to talk about in modern society; the mention of death arouses tremendous grief and isolation. There’s a general unwillingness to approach it, so we pretend it doesn’t exist. We cover it up with ideas but not proven answers, then tell ourselves that we know what we don’t.</p>

                  <br><h5> WIP </h5><br>
                  <p>The life of Ada Lovelace was, to use an understatement, was an anomaly of her time. Born in the early 1800’s, she would grow up to become an avid mathematician and would be renowned centuries later as one of the first computer programmers.</p>  
                  <p>Lovelace was taught by her mother at a young age to be passionate toward the sciences of mathematics and logic. Her mother feared that following the footsteps of Lovelace’s father Lord Byron would lead to her insanity, as it had to the former. Her pursuit of knowledge brought her many connections across scholars, including electromagnetic scientist Michael Faraday and writer Charles Dickens. Perhaps the most important connection she made, though, was with Professor Charles Babbage. Their relationship would introduce Lovelace to Babbage’s “Analytical Engine”, a machine that could manipulate numbers for computation.</p>
                  <p>The Analytical Engine would become the heart and soul of Lovelace’s work. In an article she translated on the machine, she added her own very descriptive notes on the machine, describing algorithms that it could perform, along with possible future applications beyond number-crunching. Her notes ended up being three times as long as the original article that she was to translate.</p>
                  <p>Lovelace died at the age of 36 of uterine cancer before she was able to achieve fame. Many of her notes and contributions weren’t widely known during her lifetime, sitting dormant until they were rediscovered around a hundred years later. Her notes provided valuable insight toward computing technology at the time, and helped lay the foundations of computing as we know it today. </p>
                  <p>Ada Lovelace was a woman well-ahead of her time. To be involved in high-level study in the first place was uncommon for women in the 1800s. She pondered the applications of computing devices beyond mathematics, “Supposing, for instance, that... pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose... pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.” Centuries later, we’ve abstracted the computer through so many layers that computing is practically essential to the modern human. Lovelace serves as an inspiration toward the youth, and especially the women, of today. As STEM is still a male-dominated field, it’s important to have female role models for the next generation to look up to.</p>

                    <br><h5> Bias and Prejudice </h5><br>
                    <p>It’s no secret that everyone is different; after all, that’s what makes each person an individual. In our growing interconnected society, these differences are acknowledged, and are too often taken as a means to target someone. The combination of free speech and our preconceived notions of individuals creates a messy situation where the lines between right and wrong can become blurred.</p>
                    <p>The First Amendment guarantees us, among other things, the right to speak freely. One of the consequences of this fine print means that we have to be able to tolerate the white supremacists, the racists, the anti-Semitists, and anyone else who seeks to suppress free speech for a portion of the population. Their voices have always been there, but the advent of the internet may have amplified them.</p>
                    <p>With the rise of the internet, unrestrictive platforms for mass communication have allowed hateful groups to conglomerate in echo chambers where their ideas are the only ideas that ring the bells. Targeted attacks at individuals and groups for amusement at the expense of the victim’s sanity become easy to carry out. The problem with echo chambers is the lack of awareness and perspective on the true impact of bigotry. Never before has it been so easy to inflict hatred onto others through the medium of the written word. It becomes trivial to hide behind a pseudonym, to mask oneself under an identity where their actions have no consequences on themselves. When we put on a mask, we forget that our actions can have consequences on others. </p>
                    <p>Admittedly, everyone has certain biases and tendencies, even if they exist in our subconscious minds. However, as long as we’re aware that they’re there, and we’re mindful to consider the perspectives of others, we can block these unfounded feelings from doing harm. We have to be conscious of these inner demons in order to fight them. </p>
