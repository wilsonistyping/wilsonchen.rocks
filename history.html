                  <br><h5> The War on Drugs </h5><br>
                  <p>When President Richard Nixon launched his War on Drugs campaign in 1971, he claimed that its purpose was to stop the use, spread, and smuggling of drugs. This battle marked a pivotal shift in the way drugs were perceived by the American public; substance abuse was becoming less of a psychological problem that could be fixed through therapy, and more of a criminal offense. These efforts led to a large degree of discrimination, preconception, and mass incarceration, creating stereotypes and quadrupling the United States’ prison population in just a few decades. How could a war with seemingly good intentions create a crisis with rippling effects that continue to permeate modern American society? </p>
                  <p>It is important to important to understand the true context of which the War on Drugs was founded upon. Only six years prior, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 gave African Americans the right to vote. Not everyone was for black suffrage, and the small time gap between the event and the War on Drugs meant that racial tension was still high. Recreational drug use had also begun to become more commonplace (History.com).</p>
                  <p>John Ehrlichman, domestic policy chief of President Nixon, stated that the campaign had two primary targets, “the antiwar left and black people.” He is quoted to have said the following: “We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course, we did.” Hidden under the guise of protecting America from the dangers of drug use, these minorities became increasingly targeted and criminalized by the administration under Nixon. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reported that both whites and blacks sell and use drugs at roughly the same rate, which becomes a more crucial point when considering that the white population in America outnumbers the black population around 5-to-1. However, black people made up 35% of arrests for drug possession, 55% of convictions for the offense, and 74% of imprisonments for the crime of possessing a drug, showing a large discrepancy and racial bias against the African American population.</p>
                  <p>Nixon’s efforts to combat offenders en masse trickled down to future presidencies. Ronald Reagan’s crime bill in 1986 further reinforced the overwhelmingly harsh measures by introducing strict mandatory sentences for drug offenders for the simple act of possession of a substance, even if they were non-violent. Holding 5 grams of crack cocaine prompted minimum sentencing of 5 years in prison without parole, while it took 5 hundred grams of powder cocaine to receive the same sentence. Furthermore, Bill Clinton would enact another crime bill in 1994 with “truth-in-sentencing” laws that forced violent offenders to serve at least 85% of their sentence; many people arrested for crimes decades ago are still in the same prisons and institutions today.</p>
                  <p>One of the major consequences from this perpetuating conflict, which did more to harm than to help, was to establish and reinforce stereotypes that African Americans were violent and had substance abuse issues. Today, almost 80% of people in federal prison, and almost 60% of people in state prisons for some kind of drug offense are either black or Latino. Discrimination can also be seen in our justice system, where they are “more likely to be stopped, searched, arrested, convicted, harshly sentenced and saddled with a lifelong criminal record.” America, built on the principles of freedom and liberty, houses both the highest number and the highest rate of prisoners in the entire world. At the heart of America’s obsession with drugs, crime, and violence lies a conflict built on the foundations of prejudice.</p>

                  <br><h5> Ada Lovelace </h5><br>
                  <p>The life of Ada Lovelace was, to use an understatement, was an anomaly of her time. Born in the early 1800’s, she would grow up to become an avid mathematician and would be renowned centuries later as one of the first computer programmers.</p>  
                  <p>Lovelace was taught by her mother at a young age to be passionate toward the sciences of mathematics and logic. Her mother feared that following the footsteps of Lovelace’s father Lord Byron would lead to her insanity, as it had to the former. Her pursuit of knowledge brought her many connections across scholars, including electromagnetic scientist Michael Faraday and writer Charles Dickens. Perhaps the most important connection she made, though, was with Professor Charles Babbage. Their relationship would introduce Lovelace to Babbage’s “Analytical Engine”, a machine that could manipulate numbers for computation.</p>
                  <p>The Analytical Engine would become the heart and soul of Lovelace’s work. In an article she translated on the machine, she added her own very descriptive notes on the machine, describing algorithms that it could perform, along with possible future applications beyond number-crunching. Her notes ended up being three times as long as the original article that she was to translate.</p>
                  <p>Lovelace died at the age of 36 of uterine cancer before she was able to achieve fame. Many of her notes and contributions weren’t widely known during her lifetime, sitting dormant until they were rediscovered around a hundred years later. Her notes provided valuable insight toward computing technology at the time, and helped lay the foundations of computing as we know it today. </p>
                  <p>Ada Lovelace was a woman well-ahead of her time. To be involved in high-level study in the first place was uncommon for women in the 1800s. She pondered the applications of computing devices beyond mathematics, “Supposing, for instance, that... pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose... pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.” Centuries later, we’ve abstracted the computer through so many layers that computing is practically essential to the modern human. Lovelace serves as an inspiration toward the youth, and especially the women, of today. As STEM is still a male-dominated field, it’s important to have female role models for the next generation to look up to.</p>
