        <br><h5>The Play</h5><br>
        <p>	A few weeks ago, I went to the University of South Florida to watch “Emma”, a play adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel of the same title. It was hosted by the students and faculty of the university’s College of the Arts, a labor of love from a passionate production team.</p>
        <p> As a disclaimer, I haven’t read Austen’s novel “Emma”, so this play was my first experience toward the title. To be frank, I didn’t know what to expect. Was this just a word-for-word retelling of the novel? Would I be lost without having read the book beforehand?</p>
        <p> I found my way into the theatre after having to ask a few college students for directions (I was probably lost for a good fifteen minutes while I tried to find where Theatre 2 was). Upon arrival, I was handed a brochure with all of the cast members and production crew behind the musical. Dozens of names lined the credits, with their respective role and contributions toward the show. Glancing at the back of the theatre, I found the control room run by three shadows, silhouettes of technical audio and video equipment at their ready. Directly in front stood five performers wearing regular casual attire, chatting amongst themselves while they worked on setting up the microphones.</p>
        <p> Not long later, the lights began to dim. Spotlights shined on each member of the five performers onstage. They introduced themselves as narrators, each with their own distinct flair. It became apparent that the narrators would be the omnipotent fourth-wall-breakers, their clashing personalities revealing a subplot that transcended the confines of Jane Austen’s original novel. While the play was true to form, capturing the two-centuries-old soul of the original book, small intermissions from the narrators, with their modern interpretation and youthful dynamics, transformed the show from a Victorian-era love story to an amusing comedy. </p>
        <p> The play itself was about the titular character, Emma, whose pastime of matchmaking (while not interested in a partner herself) is central to the plot. She was portrayed as very uptight and self-righteous, and she often made smug expressions. However, it was apparent that she thought she was doing the right thing. In her attempts to find a better husband for her friend Harriet Smith, she finds herself entangled with various men who are interested in her. Relationships are formed, broken, and challenged throughout the two hours of the performance, ending with resolved romantic relationships: Harriet gets together with her original lover, and Emma discovers a partner herself in her brother-in-law, George Knightley. </p>
        <p> All the while, the narrators pause the show from moment to moment, clarifying events and providing their own personal commentary through their exaggerated personas. They swooned over handsome actors, argued over the stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, eventually bringing the show to a halt in an out-all rage-fueled fight over one narrator’s continuous interruptions pointing out flawed clichés and tropes and the messages they send. </p>
        <p>I came into the show not knowing what to expect, and I left the show with a sense of admiration. The cast and crew that worked diligently to get this performance up and running had a sense of real community and passion that’s hard-pressed to observe in larger, more formal productions. There’s a whole different vibe that comes from smaller-scale productions such as these; they’re more local and confined, and everyone’s just there to have a good time. It’s very informal, which rather than detracting from the show, adds a large amount of charm. Truly a labor of love from USF’s School of the Arts, the show was an unforgettable performance. </p>

          <br><h5>The Recital</h5><br>
          <p>As a piano student, I frequently take part in the art of performance. The studio I learn at hosts a recital once at the start of each season, bringing each and every one of its students together to perform in a formal recital hall amongst our peers, parents, and friends.</p>
          <p>Recitals have traditionally been events where I’ve found myself weighed down, dozens of butterflies bouncing around my stomach in a frenzied search for release. I don’t typically do well when it comes to high pressure environments, where you and solely you are the focus of everyone’s attention. It’s daunting, to say the least, to know that at any moment you could make a fool out of yourself, finger tumbling recklessly key after key. At that moment, you’re not thinking about playing well. You’re thinking about making mistakes. There’s a glaring problem with that. Each thought with that mindset brings you closer to your downfall.</p>
          <p>Recently, I’ve learned to train my brain out of that mindset. In truth, nobody cares if you play badly. People are innately supportive, and they’ll want to see you succeed. You’re your own worst critic. Playing all the scenarios in your head where something goes wrong – you forget a portion of your piece, your tempo becomes messed up, your pedals break, you pass out and die – stops you from playing music for the sheer joy and happiness that music should bring.</p>
          <p>Instead of worrying about my upcoming performance, I paid close attention to the younger acts that played before me. In truth, they were visibly very nervous; one kid paused in the middle of her performance and couldn’t remember how to continue, her mother coming to the rescue with sheet music in hand. I was deeply sympathetic to her embarrassment, and I imagine that most others in the audience felt the same way. When she concluded her pieces and gave her awkward bow, the crowd applauded unprecedently loud, cheers of encouragement toward the young and budding musician.</p>
          <p>Then it was my turn.</p>
          <p>I won’t lie, I still had some doubts manifesting in my head while awaiting my turn for the performance. However, they subsided as soon as I placed my finger down, and played my first note. Hesitation transformed into energetic emotion as I played, aiming to give my best performance. I breezed through my piece with energy and zeal.</p>
          <p>I’ve come to realize that this spotlight effect is universal, no matter what situation you’re in. The insight that everyone experiences doubt and nervousness should be enough to reassure you that you’re doing fine. Performances should be a testament to the results of hard work and practice, and that should be your main focus. You’ll find that you’ll have a much better time doing what you love doing if you allow yourself the flexibility for mistakes and accidents.</p>

          <h5>The Museum</h5>
          <br>
          <P>Truth be told, there’s a lot I don’t know about Tampa Bay. Though I’ve lived here for the majority of my life, I’ve rarely given a second look into the history of the region. It’s a shame, too. There’s a smorgasbord of unique traditions, cultural revivals, and festivities in the area, with places like Ybor City serving as hallmarks of the historic Tampa experience. However, to truly uncover the rich layers that set the stage for Tampa Bay, a visit to the Tampa Bay History Center was in order.</P>
          <p>The museum begins on the second level of the History Center building, next to the famous Columbia Cafe. Upon setting foot inside, you’re greeted with many relics of tribal Native American culture that preceded European colonization. Hollowed out canoes, paintings of hunter-gatherers, and information plaques populated the floor. To the right is a building housing the history of Tampa Bay’s identity as the cigar capital of the world. Cigar city paints the lives of thousands of cigar workers and the social clubs they attended. Italians, Cubans, Germans, Spaniards all conglomerate in their ethnic enclaves to form a special sense of community in a city run by immigrants the world over.</p>
          <P>On the third level, a transition from the early pioneering roots of Florida to the modernization and militarization of the region. Cattle ranching and orange farming were important parts of Tampa’s early economy, which you can learn about while you ride cattle, inspect orange quality, and watch a film inside of a shipping container. Nearby, you’ll learn about Henry Plant, a key railroad investor who laid the groundwork toward rapid population growth of the inner swamps and marshes of Florida. Following the road, you’ll see the development of MacDill Air Force Base, and discover the role of the region in various wars. </P>
          <p>The fourth and final floor of the history center is a testimony to the wonders of exploration and the discovery of uncharted territory. The main exhibit is reminiscent of a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, with segments covering ships, maps, and shipwrecks. Lost and uncovered treasures including gold and silver coins are displayed, encrusted by corals and mineral deposits. Old maps reveal the complexity of Florida’s geography – one splits up Florida into a grid-based township system, while another traces the transportation lines that connect major cities in the area. Another section of the gallery is dedicated solely toward documenting the indigenous bird species. Detailed life-like sketches of these animals are placed, and stories about wildlife protection are conveyed. </p>
          <p>Throughout the museum experience, I discovered the rich history of Tampa Bay. Knowing more about the culture and the past of Tampa allowed me to appreciate the sheer magnitude to the lives which the region housed, from its cattle ranchers and orange farmers to its ethnic social clubs and pirate plunderers. It’s a very humbling feeling to realize you walk on the grounds that Native Americans lived hundreds of years ago, where each step I take represents a slice of life experienced by others before I was born. </p>

            <h5>The World Trade Center</h5>
            <br>
            <p>During Thanksgiving Break, my family began our annual pilgrimage to New York City, where our origins in America began. My mother and father, childhood friends from China, had both taken the route to New York on separate paths. It was through impossible odds that they met each other again, two Chinese misfits in a bustling megalopolis of eight million. They eventually married, with a ceremony at the Twin Towers. Eventually, I would be born in a hospital in Manhattan. To my parents, New York was where they found a new life. As for me, I was the new life, a product of the American dream. </p>
            <p>We typically visited New York on holidays to be with my grandparents, who had come to America some time after my parents. This year, we wanted to do something different. While we were no stranger to the familiar streets of Queens, the rest of New York City was foreign to us. Funnily enough, we never really explored New York City all that often; perhaps we just didn’t really have the mindset of a tourist. However, this time we sought to explore the city to uncover the stories it held – the stories that define a nation. </p>
            <p>So this time, we went to visit the One World Trade Center. Where better to see the endurance and stubborn bravado of America? Its very existence seemed to boast to the rest of the world, indulging itself in a distinctly sharp and modern architecture that pierced the skyline. At the One World Observatory, we could witness this firsthand.</p>
            <p>Going up over 100 stories of the skyscraper is an experience in and of itself. The interior of the elevators are walled with giant screens, playing an immersive cinematic of New York City’s beginnings and its evolution, with your perspective gradually shifting higher and higher as you are taken up flight by flight. You begin at the bedrock layer, moving your way up to a fertile river with plentiful trees, log cabins dotting the landscape. The trees disappear, larger townhouses are built. A church is erected, its steeple a beacon to a rapidly growing town. The harbor is constructed, and buildings stretching five to ten stories begin to emerge. In no time at all, more of these buildings are built, challenging each other to go higher and higher, competing for a space in the silhouette of the greatest city in the world. Suddenly, your view is obstructed, steel bars and scaffolding quickly floating into place. One World Trade Center is constructed before your eyes. The elevator halts. Letters engraved onto the concrete of the elevator shaft read “Floor 102”. You’re here. </p>
            <p>After a short introductory video on the top floors of the buildings, we walked along a narrow hallway to go to the 102th floor, curtains covering the windows on the left side. A couple tourists expressed frustration; they were on the top floor, why weren’t they allowed to look out? Two tour guides behind us urged us to keep the line moving forward. At the end of it, an elevator. It carried us further upwards, its conclusion exposing a 360 view of the entire city. </p>
            <p>I looked down. Cars and people marched through the city. Each miniscule person, an ant from atop the observatory, had their own significant role. I was an outsider, peering into the worlds of thousands of pedestrians making purposeful strides in their black blobs of suits and brown dots of briefcases, day in and day out. The innumerable streets and avenues breathed in and out as cars slowly made their way through traffic, veins transporting blood to the heartbeat of the city. New York City, I realized, is a sort of macro-organism, and we’re the blood cells keeping it alive.</p>
            <p>Somehow, I didn’t feel like I was just an insignificant human being who was just floating along in the grand scheme of things. I realized that, even in the logarithmic proportionality of scale, we didn’t need to be big to be important. Each person had a lifetime of stories too large to be able to comprehensively digest. My mother and father, a rich story of immigration and unforeseen love, were to an observer just two insignificant people, walking on the same grounds of millions. But to me, each speck in the distance now held a lifetime of experiences that they alone could understand. Focusing on an African-American woman in a suit and tie in the far distance, I wondered what stories her history might have revealed.</p>
            <p>Within every single human being lies a wealth of knowledge, experiences, and memories. In our current day and age, we’re often too caught up on our own lives to reflect on our larger contributions to the world. When we really do step back, reminisce at all of our accomplishments, it’s surprising just how significant an individual can be. And when groups of individuals work together for a common purpose, we become exponentially more powerful, able to accomplish anything that the collective sets its mind to.</p>
