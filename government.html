              <p>Freakonomics is, at its core, an investigative look into the many assumptions and fallacies that we take for granted. With its cross-disciplinary examination of distinct social phenomenon – the similarities between the mindsets of the Ku Klux Klan and Real Estate Agents, the organizational structures of criminal gangs and McDonalds – each page challenges our pre-conceived conclusions and uncovers the true nature of our complex society.</p>
              <p>But there’s one particular section of the book that I’d like to put my focus on. It’s an unassuming story at first, about a small-scale entrepreneur and his bagel business. However, in the grand scheme of things, it’s about lessons in trust, circumstance, and corruption in everyday citizens.</p>
              <p>It’s about Paul Feldman’s bagels, which sprouted while he was still employed in an office job. Feldman would buy a few dozen bagels for the office staff to enjoy every week, with a sign of the suggested price placed by an unattended basket of cash. He collected about 95% of what he should’ve earned and considered the other 5% to be an oversight rather than bagel thievery.</p>
              <p>As life would have it, Feldman would find himself quitting his office job to start a business selling bagels to various office parks. The idea was simple enough. Bring in some bagels every morning to the snack rooms of these offices, with the same basket and suggested price system that he had used at the job he’d quit. Before lunch, collect all of the money and leftover bagels. Feldman kept a record of all of the statistics regarding his bagel business. How many consumers didn’t pay for their bagels? Which companies were more likely to have lower rates of honesty? This rich database of statistics on his bagel business would lead to some intriguing conclusions.</p>
              <p>Let’s look into one of the more pressing questions in any business venture: where did the money go? Feldman came to regard companies with more than 90% payment rates “honest”, rates between 80% and 90% “tolerable”, and “dishonest” for anything below, a departure from his 95% payment rate at his old job. Furthermore, he found too often that his open baskets of money would vanish, a culprit of white-collar thievery. Feldman resorted to a slotted plywood box as his collection method, which proved far more secure. Each year, only a single box out of the seven thousand or so boxes he delivered was stolen. This raises an important question: why do the same office workers that routinely steal more than 10% of his bagels stop themselves from stealing the box? Either case, a crime is being committed, stealing money from Feldman’s business. Maybe the customers just don’t believe that stealing a bagel without paying counts as a crime, especially when there isn’t anyone there to enforce it.</p>
              <p>There’s plenty of more interesting observations to be made about Feldman’s statistics. For example, the aftermath of September 11th, 2001, brought up a not insignificant increase in the payment rate, reverting its slow downward trend. Furthermore, weather interestingly plays a major role in whether or not someone pays. More people pay when the weather’s pleasant, and less people pay in the presence of bad weather. Surprisingly, there are holidays in which people steal more, and holidays where the payment rate goes up. Christmas, Valentines Day, and Thanksgiving are offenders of increased bagel theft, while the Fourth of July, Labor Day, and Columbus Day inspire more people to pay, for some reason. </p>
              <p>While we can go on and on about statistics (and rest assured, there’s still an abundance of them), let’s instead go back to the overall conclusions of this study. If we’re looking at it from a pessimistic end, sure, it seems bad that roughly 10% of customers regularly steal from his bagel business. However, if you switch the statistic around, you’ll be happy to find that around 90% of customers don’t steal in Feldman’s honor system. An overwhelming majority of customers use their moral compasses to give back to the bagel giver, even with the anonymity. So then. Are people by nature evil? Given the knowledge that no one’s watching over their actions, do their evils triumph their morals? The answer, in the eyes of a bagel seller? No.</p>
