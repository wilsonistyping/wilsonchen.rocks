      <p>A year ago, on Valentines Day, 19 year old Nicolas Cruz killed 17 people and wounded 15 others in a cold-hearted massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Ever since then, the issue of gun control has been syndicated across the entire country, becoming an issue of national importance. However, as we get caught up in this debate over the acquisition of firearms, it’s important to remember all of the lives impacted by the actions of one killer.</p>
      <p>Recently, Marjory Stoneman Douglas produced yet another victim when alumnus Sydney Aiello shot herself in the head. She was friends with Meadow Pollock, a victim of the shooting a year prior. She faced tremendous survivor’s guilt over her friend’s untimely departure. Meadow’s brother, Hunter Pollack, grieved, writing “Rest in peace, Sydney. Take care of Meadow for me." (https://abcnews.go.com/US/sydney-aiello-19-year-parkland-survivor-dies-suicide/story?id=61869606). Seeing your best friends bleed and die is extremely unnerving. Post-traumatic stress disorder lingers in the heads of all those impacted in some way through the massacre. </p>
      <p>Only a week after Aiello’s suicide, another Stoneman Douglas student, Calvin Desir, would take his life as well. Though his cause of death and reason for suicide have not been disclosed, it’s very likely that trauma from the shooting played an important role. Many people have gotten onto social media platforms to mourn alongside the grieving families, with the message “17+2” representing these new additions to the death toll. Both Aiello’s and Desir’s parents have set up GoFundMe pages to help pay for funeral expenses and support (https://www.local10.com/news/parkland-school-shooting/police-identify-stoneman-douglas-student-took-his-own-life).</p>
      <p>In consideration of the recent back-to-back suicides from survivors of the Parkland shooting, Broward County officials are stressing the need for a response. Clinical psychologist Dr. Dara Bushman has been helping with local remediation, counseling with students, family members, and other community members. She provides insight on what may have gone on in the heads of the suicide victims, saying “They are feeling in pain and are questioning their own existence. They are wondering why they got to live and these other kids didn't.” Similar resource centers are opening up, and awareness is continuing to be raised. A town hall meeting is also being held to discuss suicide prevention (https://www.local10.com/news/parkland-school-shooting/help-is-available-officials-stress-after-parkland-suicides).</p>
      <p>There’s no easy way to recover from a traumatic event of such a degree. However, it can be done, and any step taken to help alleviate the mental aftermath of such a tragedy should be taken earnestly. We need to come together as a community and allow ourselves the freedom to open ourselves up to others with understanding and compassion. More awareness needs to be drawn to resources like the Suicide Prevention Hotline, and the public perception of this topic should become less taboo. It’s up to all of us to provide this network of support to remind each other that our lives are precious.</p>
