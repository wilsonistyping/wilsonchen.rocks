      <p>As the first quarter of the school year streaked by, I began to notice a distinct occurrence that seemed to plague more than half of the students in my friend group. Day by day, I became increasingly aware of patterns these students would show. Glances at their faces, movements, actions, and their work ethic – dead giveaways. Their condition? Sleep deprivation.</p>
      <p>Popular science tells us that adolescents are recommended at least eight hours of sleep per night. Sleeping is especially important in the teenage years, as during the sleep process, the developing brain is becoming more and more mature. Lack of sleep hinders these important subconscious processes and leads to a lower degree of well-being. The gist is, sleep is beneficial, and lack of sleep is harmful. The decision to adhere to the eight hour rule seems, then, to be pretty obvious, doesn’t it?</p>
      <p>In reality, I found that barely anyone I know actually follows these guidelines. In an admittedly informal investigation, I surveyed a few students I was friends with, asking them to estimate how long they slept on an average school night. Going in, I expected many to be around the eight hour goal, even if they didn’t hit it. Seven hours, even around six, was where I presumed most people would fall, with the inevitable outlier here or there. The results, however, completely changed my perspective.</p>
      <p>I should add, before I get to the data, that I’m a frequent follower of the eight hour rule. I’ve become wired through habit to feel an urge to sleep around 9:30PM, and I wake up at 6:30AM feeling wide awake on most days. Occasionally, this routine is broken on weekends and deadlines, but this typically characterizes my normal sleep schedule. I took for granted the idea that the eight hour rule should be maintained, which led to my conservative estimates.</p>
      <img class="responsive-img" src="images/sleepstudychart.jpg">
      <p>Although the names are taken out to protect privacy, these are all people that I know very well. For a lack of a better word to describe my reaction, I found it staggering that many of my friends, after all this time, were regularly running off of roughly five hours. To put that in perspective, that’s a roughly 1:00AM to 2:00AM sleep time, assuming my classmates wake up around 6:00AM to 7:00AM. </p>
      <p>There’s a running joke that engineering students get the short end of the stick when it comes to the economy of sleep. Student C, the one CSIT student that I was able to survey, commented “I’m not in engineering, bud”, implying that he gets more sleep because he’s not in that magnet (although interestingly, his 6 hour sleep number is still pretty low in comparison to the goal). For the most part, the data seems to support the saying that engineering students get no sleep. An outlier lies in Student J, though I know him to be a very intrinsically motivated and dedicated person. </p>
      <p>What are some probable causes that most students don’t get enough sleep? For most engineering students, the answer seems to be the heavy workloads they are assigned. Projects are a very demanding part of their curriculum, and there are many components are turned in and meticulously graded for assessment. However, blaming the work can become too easy of a scapegoat. What about Engineering student J, who is assigned the same projects, takes many AP classes, and still meets the eight hour goal? I’m taking six AP classes this year as well, and although the workload is intense, I find that smart allocation of time and resource management allows me to be productive without sacrificing shuteye. There’s a case that could be made about a trend of waiting until the last minute to do the work, but that doesn’t consider the days without deadlines. Filling in those gaps could be escapism from the stress of the real world: video games, movies, TV series, YouTube, social media, among others. Perhaps, even, it’s school culture; “Real Tigor Hours”, the phrase signifying being up past midnight, is used by Middleton students in jest as a test of might and endurance. </p>
      <p>While the informal investigation I conducted is by no means representative of the school, the data collected does raise newfound insights and is altering my perception of our student body.</p>

      <br><h5> Mornings at Middleton </h5><br>
      <p>I usually arrive at Middleton High School around 7:30 AM, an hour before school starts. Besides the roughly ten people sitting around the cafeteria, there’s not really anything going on. Over the course of the school year, I’ve made it a habit to just walk around the campus to brighten my spirits for the day. </p>
      <p>I often find squirrels running around, one chasing the other in a sort of game of tag. They scurry up and down the bark of scattered trees that provide some degree of contrast to the otherwise flat landscape. When I get closer to their vicinity, they stop playing and freeze, as squirrels often do, assessing whether or not I’m a threat. After I walk past them though, their play session continues. I seldom see this band of squirrels anytime after the morning; when more people arrive at the school, I think they prefer to hide in the safe comforts of the treetops instead. One person’s intimidating enough. The thousand-plus student body of Middleton is piranha territory.</p>
      <p>I’ll wander the halls when the setting of the courtyard repeats itself lap after lap. As the time slowly drifts toward 8:25, I find more people wandering the halls, many familiar faces of students and teachers. I make a conscious effort to greet them, give them just a bit of a warm feeling to help start off their day. If I can find something to talk about, I’ll often set aside a few minutes to chat with them. We complain about physics homework together, compare scores on the recent APUSH test, ask each other what we’ve been up to. </p>
      <p>Recently, I’ve been hanging around the student parking lot more often. Many of my junior friends have their own cars now, and they tend to retreat to the confines of the driver’s seat until the bell rings for school to begin. I often make small talk, hang around my friends for the mutual satisfaction of companionship. Sometimes I’ll sit in the back of my friend’s truck with other friends, gazing at the cars pulling in – maybe purposely shaking the flatbed a bit too much, annoying my friend inside. </p>
      <p>A lot of my friends lay dormant in the cafeteria, playing video games or finishing the rest of the homework that they were too tired to finish the night before. I used to often do that too, freshman and sophomore year. But I wanted my junior year at Middleton to be different. I wanted to be less sedentary and more purposeful, doing my work on time so I didn’t have to waste precious time that could be spent building friendships. I’ve found that starting the day off on the right note is critical to make the rest of the day enjoyable and productive.</p>

      <p>It’s a phenomenon that has defined the terminal stage of one’s high school career, when a senior simply doesn’t have the motivation to actively participate in school anymore. They end up taking easier classes, skipping school, dropping out of AP courses, and procrastinating to the point of no return. What’s at the root of all this, and why is it so prevalent in many school systems?</p>
      <p>At a glance, this seems very counterintuitive. The senior is willingly wasting away the last and most important year of high school. They need their last few credits in order to graduate, and their GPA still matters to the colleges that keep a close eye on them. Downward trends in grades could even cause colleges to rescind admission offers.</p>
      <p>I’ve seen it in many of my senior friends this year. One opened up their Edsby account to me, showing the various F’s, D’s, and C’s lying around the gradebook. They’ve told me that they’ve skipped a teacher’s class when they weren’t “in the mood”, opting instead for an extra hour of sleep in the morning. Another one’s yet to finish their Florida Virtual School course, doing only the minimum required modules for every week. There’s not much time left, either. Florida Virtual School courses have to be complete a few weeks before graduation, and this person’s less than halfway through.</p>
      <p>So what gives? Shouldn’t this be the final stretch, the last burst of speed before the finish line where you can finally say you’ve made it? Why give up so close to the end? In the eyes of some of my senior friends, they just want to get high school over with. It doesn’t matter if they tank their GPA now, as long as they can do the minimum amount of work required to maintain their graduation requirements, why bother doing anything more? It seems like they’ve just completely burnt out, unwilling to be in the institution of education any longer.</p>
      <p>I won't fall on that path.</p>
