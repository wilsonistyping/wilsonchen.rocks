    <p>I squashed a mosquito in the bathroom of our house today.</p>
    <p>I was out on the patio exercising when I heard my little sister call my name with a mildly panicked tone. She told me that there was a giant mosquito flying on the walls of the master bathroom, and she asked me to kill it.</p>
    <p>So there I went. Sure enough, as I walked in, an almond-sized mosquito with spider-like legs bounced nonchalantly along the white tiles lining the bathroom wall. I grabbed a paper towel and struck it down in one fell swoop.</p>
    <p>The mosquito bouncing with life just moments prior succumbed to gravity, a life lost in less than a blink of an eye.</p>
    <p> ... </p>
    <p>If there’s one thing that I fear most in life, it’s its absence. With death, we lose our consciousness, and in consequence, we lose ourselves. Life is something that we only have temporarily, and it’s something we’ll never have again (unless some miracles are discovered in this century).</p>
    <p>For a moment, I felt bad for that bug. I felt bad for the millions of organisms that die every moment, because for all we know, they’re alive. At least, they were.</p>
    <p>None of us knows what happens when we die. The religious amongst us say we go elsewhere, to heaven or hell, or some other world altogether. Others believe in reincarnation, where our memories get wiped and we begin anew.</p>
    <p>While these answers may give us peace of mind about our imminent deaths, what happens to the mosquito? Is there a separate heaven for mosquitoes? What about factory-raised cows, bred and killed for mass consumption? What’s it like to be an unfortunate ant, at the wrong place at the wrong time, trampled by an unaware human on their daily commute to work?</p>
    <p>The fragility of life seems to be too taboo to talk about in modern society; the mention of death arouses tremendous grief and isolation. There’s a general unwillingness to approach it, so we pretend it doesn’t exist. We cover it up with ideas but not proven answers, then tell ourselves that we know what we don’t.</p>

    <p>In light of the recent Harvard lawsuit concerning allegations of affirmative action policies that discriminate against Asian Americans, I wanted to better understand the true nature of the situation. Statistics show that White and Asian race groups attend higher education at rates disproportionate to those of African or Hispanic origins. The latter are also less likely to achieve the level of success as the former. These trends that separate races apart shouldn’t be dismissed as internal, unchangeable characteristics of a population; that massively oversimplifies the issue while also making proponents racist. Rather, these factors can be attributed to the history, environment, and culture that has reciprocated amongst generations, or their socioeconomic status. </p>
    <p>When we examine the history of African Americans in our country, it’s no secret that they were originally brought en masse as slaves. Slaves were considered the property of their masters, seen as objects and not citizens of America. Over the years, slavery was outlawed, but racist sentiments still plagued much of the United States. Thus, slaves had inferior quality of education in relation to their white counterparts, masked through the logically flawed idea of “separate but equal” brought about by Plessy v Ferguson. In comparison with blacks, whites had far better institutions for rising up the socioeconomic pyramid. The absence of similar-quality institutions for blacks kept socioeconomic status kept their socioeconomic status low, leading to a high rate of illiteracy and poverty that would set the foundations for the trends we see today.</p>
    <p>We don’t get to decide the circumstances under which we are born. If we could, however, we would undoubtedly prefer to be born under a family with high socioeconomic standing. Parents with a high level of education and income have better resources to develop their child, as compared to a lower-class family where both parents must work long days to provide for bare necessities, often sacrificing vital parent-child connections in the process. When it comes to college admissions, years of personal tutoring and privatized educational opportunities grant the population with high socioeconomic status a major advantage against a low-class citizen fighting their way toward the top. The rich grow richer, while the poor remain poor.</p>
    <p>When it comes to policies regarding affirmative action, I believe that they have been made with good intentions. However, they can become understandably controversial when they draw from assumptions that Whites and Asians always have an edge over Hispanics and Blacks. People of similar socioeconomic statuses tend to have similar results when it comes to intelligence testing and success. Rather than race-based affirmative action, a system that emphasizes the situation behind a candidate rather than their color can work to level the playing field while keeping it fair.</p>

    <p>It’s no secret that everyone is different; after all, that’s what makes each person an individual. In our growing interconnected society, these differences are acknowledged, and are too often taken as a means to target someone. The combination of free speech and our preconceived notions of individuals creates a messy situation where the lines between right and wrong can become blurred.</p>
    <p>The First Amendment guarantees us, among other things, the right to speak freely. One of the consequences of this fine print means that we have to be able to tolerate the white supremacists, the racists, the anti-Semitists, and anyone else who seeks to suppress free speech for a portion of the population. Their voices have always been there, but the advent of the internet may have amplified them.</p>
    <p>With the rise of the internet, unrestrictive platforms for mass communication have allowed hateful groups to conglomerate in echo chambers where their ideas are the only ideas that ring the bells. Targeted attacks at individuals and groups for amusement at the expense of the victim’s sanity become easy to carry out. The problem with echo chambers is the lack of awareness and perspective on the true impact of bigotry. Never before has it been so easy to inflict hatred onto others through the medium of the written word. It becomes trivial to hide behind a pseudonym, to mask oneself under an identity where their actions have no consequences on themselves. When we put on a mask, we forget that our actions can have consequences on others. </p>
    <p>Admittedly, everyone has certain biases and tendencies, even if they exist in our subconscious minds. However, as long as we’re aware that they’re there, and we’re mindful to consider the perspectives of others, we can block these unfounded feelings from doing harm. We have to be conscious of these inner demons in order to fight them. </p>
